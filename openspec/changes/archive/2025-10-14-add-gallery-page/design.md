## Context

The gallery page is a critical conversion tool for the beauty salon, providing visual proof of service quality and salon atmosphere. This feature introduces a new client-facing capability that must be performant, accessible, and visually impressive while maintaining consistency with the existing pink-to-rose gradient brand aesthetic.

### Background
- Current landing page has testimonials but lacks visual proof
- Beauty industry customers heavily rely on before/after photos
- Competitors typically showcase portfolios prominently
- Instagram integration is a future consideration but starting with static gallery

### Constraints
- Must load quickly on mobile devices (target: <3s)
- Images must be optimized (WebP format preferred)
- Should work without JavaScript for basic functionality (progressive enhancement)
- Must support both portrait and landscape orientations

### Stakeholders
- **End Users**: Potential customers researching services
- **Salon Owners**: Need easy way to update gallery content
- **Marketing Team**: Require analytics on which images drive engagement

## Goals / Non-Goals

### Goals
- Create visually appealing, filterable image gallery
- Provide smooth, animated interactions using Aceternity UI
- Enable full-screen image viewing with lightbox
- Maintain fast page load performance with lazy loading
- Support easy content updates (image file-based approach)
- Ensure mobile-first responsive design

### Non-Goals
- No admin upload interface (file-based for MVP)
- No image editing/cropping tools in-app
- No social media integration in initial release
- No video gallery support (images only)
- No user-submitted photos or reviews

## Decisions

### Technical Decisions

#### Decision 1: File-based Gallery vs Database
**Choice**: File-based with JSON/TypeScript config  
**Rationale**: 
- Simpler initial implementation
- No backend/database required
- Images can be version-controlled
- Easy to migrate to CMS later
- Faster development time

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Database with upload interface - Too complex for MVP
- Headless CMS (Sanity, Contentful) - Adds external dependency

#### Decision 2: Gallery Component Library
**Choice**: Use Aceternity UI components + custom implementation  
**Rationale**:
- Consistent with existing component choices
- Beautiful animations out of the box
- Customizable to match brand

**Alternatives Considered**:
- React Photo Gallery - Less visual appeal
- Lightgallery.js - Heavy dependency
- Custom from scratch - Time intensive

#### Decision 3: Layout Style
**Choice**: Masonry/Pinterest-style grid  
**Rationale**:
- Handles mixed aspect ratios elegantly
- Modern, visually appealing
- Industry standard for portfolios

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Uniform grid - Requires cropping images
- Carousel/slider - Limits visibility
- Full-screen slideshow - Poor mobile UX

#### Decision 4: Category System
**Choice**: Fixed categories with filter UI  
**Categories**: Hair, Nails, Makeup, Spa, Interior, All  
**Rationale**:
- Matches service offerings on main page
- Simple to understand and navigate
- Easy to implement with client-side filtering

#### Decision 5: Image Storage
**Choice**: Next.js public folder with organized subdirectories  
**Structure**:
```
public/gallery/
  ├── hair/
  ├── nails/
  ├── makeup/
  ├── spa/
  └── interior/
```
**Rationale**:
- Leverages Next.js static file serving
- Organized by category for easy management
- Can use Next.js Image component for optimization

## Architecture

### Component Structure
```
app/gallery/
  └── page.tsx                 # Gallery route page
components/
  ├── gallery-grid.tsx         # Main grid layout
  ├── gallery-filter.tsx       # Category filter tabs
  ├── image-lightbox.tsx       # Full-screen viewer
  └── gallery-card.tsx         # Individual image card
lib/
  └── gallery-data.ts          # Image metadata config
```

### Data Structure
```typescript
interface GalleryImage {
  id: string;
  src: string;
  category: 'hair' | 'nails' | 'makeup' | 'spa' | 'interior';
  alt: string;
  description?: string;
  width?: number;
  height?: number;
}
```

### User Flow
1. User clicks "Gallery" in navigation
2. Gallery page loads with all images (or default category)
3. User can filter by category using tab/button interface
4. Clicking an image opens lightbox with full-size view
5. User can navigate between images in lightbox
6. Closing lightbox returns to filtered grid state

## Performance Strategy

### Image Optimization
- Use Next.js Image component with automatic optimization
- Serve WebP format with JPEG fallback
- Implement blur placeholders for loading states
- Target sizes: 
  - Thumbnail: 400x400 (approx)
  - Full-size: 1200px max width

### Loading Strategy
- Initial load: First 12-18 images
- Infinite scroll or "Load More" button for additional images
- Lazy load images outside viewport
- Preload next 3 images in lightbox for smooth navigation

### Bundle Size
- Code-split gallery components
- Dynamic import lightbox only when needed
- Target: <50KB additional JavaScript

## Risks / Trade-offs

### Risk 1: Image Quality vs Performance
**Mitigation**: 
- Use Next.js automatic image optimization
- Provide guidelines for ideal image dimensions
- Monitor Core Web Vitals with Lighthouse

### Risk 2: Content Management Complexity
**Trade-off**: File-based approach requires developer involvement  
**Mitigation**: 
- Clear documentation for adding images
- Consider Cloudflare Images or similar in future
- Plan migration path to CMS if needed

### Risk 3: Browser Compatibility
**Mitigation**:
- Test on major browsers
- Provide fallbacks for older browsers
- Use progressive enhancement approach

## Migration Plan

### Implementation Steps
1. Add gallery components with sample images
2. Test performance and user experience
3. Replace sample images with professional salon photos
4. Add analytics tracking for popular categories
5. Monitor and optimize based on real user data

### Rollback Strategy
- Feature can be removed by deleting route and components
- No database changes to revert
- Navigation link can be conditionally rendered

### Future Enhancements
- Admin upload interface
- Instagram API integration for live feed
- Before/after slider component
- Customer testimonials linked to specific images
- Video support for transformation timelapses

## Open Questions

1. **Image sourcing**: Should we use Unsplash placeholders initially or wait for real photos?
   - Recommendation: Use beauty salon stock photos from Unsplash initially, organize by category

2. **Analytics**: What metrics should we track for gallery engagement?
   - Recommendation: Track category filter usage, popular images, lightbox open rate

3. **Mobile gestures**: Should lightbox support swipe gestures for navigation?
   - Recommendation: Yes, implement swipe left/right for next/previous image

4. **SEO**: Should we add JSON-LD structured data for images?
   - Recommendation: Yes, add ImageObject schema for better search visibility
