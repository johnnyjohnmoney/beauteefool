## Why

The Beauteefool beauty salon landing page currently lacks visual proof of the quality of work and salon atmosphere. Potential customers need to see real examples of completed services, the salon interior, and the professional environment to build trust and make informed booking decisions. A gallery page will showcase before/after transformations, service examples, and create visual appeal that drives conversions.

## What Changes

- Add a new `/gallery` route with dedicated page
- Create interactive gallery component with categories/filtering
- Implement image grid layout with lightbox/modal viewing
- Add category filtering (Hair, Nails, Makeup, Spa, Salon Interior)
- Include smooth animations and transitions using Aceternity UI components
- Add navigation link to gallery in main navigation
- Implement responsive image gallery that works on all devices
- Support both grid and masonry layout options
- Add image lazy loading for performance
